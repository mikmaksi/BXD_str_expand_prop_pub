The goal here is to create an R package called BXDstrs, which would bundle relevant data frames and commonly used functions in a portable way for BXD related analyses.

1. `BXDstrs`: the R package directory
2. `package_setup.R`: code needed to set up the R package and build/install it
3. `archive`: originally had the idea to keep function separate from the `R` directory of the package and just copy them there, but now think it is easier to work from inside of the package directory itself.
4. `tests`: incomplete for now
